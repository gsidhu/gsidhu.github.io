Indeed it is.

Whoa. Took me an entire day to get this running. A day so long it seems like two right now. I have slept only 3 hours in the last 48, it's like I am back in finals month. I am surprised though, now that I think of it, I effectively put only 6-7 hours in this. I started from scratch, learned Jekyll, tried reasoning with Poole, stalked Tobias Ahlin and [got favorited by him on Twitter](https://twitter.com/gurjotsidhu/status/485564287088209920). Intense 24 hours lately.

Whatevz.

The site is up now, with all the links working, complete with a [404 page](./404.html) and all that. (Check the fancy **Back to top** link on the bottom of this page)

###Bug control
Infinite Scroll on the blog page doesn't work right now, the spinner does, and I need to add an index of all posts somewhere, and I need to update the content. And I should probably get rid of the updates page, merge it with the blog page.

Also, sleep.
