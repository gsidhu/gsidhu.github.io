# My Friggin' Plans

### 12 Jul 2014

I have been hogging Github's servers for nearly a week now, so I decided to find a faux justification for it - this post.

## My rig
1. **Laptop** : Asus X550LC. Intel Haswell Processor, Nvidia GeForce 720M, 4 GB RAM, 750 GB HDD. Ubuntu 14.04 Trusty and Windows 8 Professional dual boot.
2. **Phone** : Sony Xperia U. [Android 4.4.3 AOSX ROM (AOSP, CM 11 based)](http://forum.xda-developers.com/xperia-u/u-development/rom-xperia-aosx-rom-t2716190)
3. **Misc** : Amazon Kindle. Recently acquired!

I plan on getting a backup external hard drive, an iPod classic and, when I am rich enough, a 13" MacBook Air. Also if I am in dire need of a new phone, it'll probably be a Nexus 5, given how Google doesn't seem too eager to make new phones.

-----------

I have no idea why I posted that.

Anyway, I plan to use this blog space to write about science - I have been reading, learning and watching a lot of stuff lately. And if science is here, can technology be far behind? I do lots of scripting in Python, to make my life easy mainly, so I thought maybe I will post little tutes/reviews about things that I do.

Nothing too fancy, just whatever floats my goat.

Peas.
